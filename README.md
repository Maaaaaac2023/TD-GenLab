# TD-GenLab
Data-driven Kingdom Rush–style tower defense with a generative pipeline. Build/upgrade towers with earned coins and control a skill-based hero. Stable Diffusion enhances tile-map art (mask segmentation + 48×48 decor), while a conditional VAE generates difficulty-controlled waves exportable to the game format.
